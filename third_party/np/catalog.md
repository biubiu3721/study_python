Chapter 1.

Teach how to install numpy, and create an basic Numpy app.

Chapter 2. 

Introduce Numpy  array object and some basic function.

Chapter 3. 

Teach how to use most useful basic math and statistic analysis functions in Numpy.

Chapter 4.

Describes how to use Numpy in a convenient way, including slice a part in a array,  fit poly, and manipulate the shape of Numpy object.

Chapter 5.

Involves matrix and unify functions. Matrix is wildly used, and specific object is designed to express matrix. Unify functions (ufuncs) is a scalar function used to process Numpy object, and its inputs is a set of scalar as well as returning a set of scalar as output.

Chapter 6. 

Discuss basic module in 'ufuncs'. 'ufuncs' usually could map to math operations, such like add, minus, multiply, division.

Chapter 7. 

Introduces dedicated functions in Numpy, as an user of Numpy, we frequent aware some special demands. However, Numpy could  satisfy most of what we need.

Chapter 8.

Introduce how to compile Unit test code in Numpy.

Chapter 9.

Introduces recommended drawing lib, Matplotlib in depth. Although Numpy do not supply drawing functions, the Matplotlib and NumPy could joint perfectly which challenges the drawing ability in Matlab.

Chapter 10.

Introduces SciPy moreover. As mentioned before, SciPy and NumPy has some historical origins. SciPy is a high-tier scientific computing frame, and it can be used with NumPy simultaneously.
